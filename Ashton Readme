The project that I helped with is an alarm system.
When the motion sensor is set off a buzzer beeps until a password, which is four buttons in a certain order, is put in and the the alarm rearms after one minute.
We were planning on using a camera and a keypad but we had issues with both so we ended up not using them.
I help with the LED and tried to fiqure out how to use the camera and the keypad.
Also helped with the hardware part of the project.
The project can help to world by giving an alarm system that is kinda cheap for the people that can not afford the high tech ones.
