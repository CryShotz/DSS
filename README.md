Code for the security system project
My name is Eli Rainey and I go to Hardin County Highschool, where I take the computer science class.
I was the main hardware dev in the project. The amount of wires to keep track of was insane!
The project was good and and ended well.
There was mostly one difficult spot to get through. We were trying to get the buttons to turn off the alarm system with a certain combination.
We finally go it to work right before Thanksgiving break.
My favorite part was the hardware for the project. I'll admit, I probably could have made it a little more organized, but it works, so whatever.
The project went through several plans before we settled on the main design. At first we planned for it to have a camera but then we realized we were a bit over our heads, so we scrapped it.
